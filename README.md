### Project Overview
---

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the employees performance in the company. By analyzing various aspects of the data, we seek to answer the following questions that Top management specifically need to know which are:
1. What is the correlation between an employee's performance rating and their salary, age, or job level?
2. Is there a difference in employee satisfaction levels between different departments in the company?
3. How does an employee's job level relate to their likelihood to leave the company?
4. How does the length of time an employee has been with the company impact their salary and performance rating?
5. What is the most common reason for employee attrition, and is there a pattern to when employees leave the company (e.g. by age, tenure, or performance rating)?
